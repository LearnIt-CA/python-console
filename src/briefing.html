                <p class="mission-text">In February 2025, a hacker known as "<span class="highlight">Phantom</span>" 
                    successfully breached the security systems of Cyberex Exchange, 
                    resulting in the theft of cryptocurrency assets valued at 
                    approximately <span class="highlight">$1.5 billion USD</span>.</p>
                
                <p class="mission-text">Our intelligence division has discovered that Phantom 
                    communicates with potential buyers through an encrypted channel using a seemingly innocent 
                    "<span class="highlight">Higher or Lower</span>" game as a covert messaging system before executing 
                    large transactions.</p>
                
                <p class="mission-text">The CSIS Cyber Division, in collaboration with LearnIT's Python 
                    specialists, has recruited you to help intercept and decode these 
                    communications.</p>
                
                <p class="mission-text">Your mission is to use <span class="highlight">Python</span> to reverse-engineer his game system 
                    and develop a replacement that will allow us to monitor his 
                    communications while appearing identical to his original system.</p>
